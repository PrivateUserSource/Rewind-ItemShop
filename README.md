# Rewind-ItemShop
This form will help you contribute to rewind and help us create daily itemshops
Here's how to use this form

thank you @eonOGFN for the idea

the template folder contains more folders.
Rename your folder to the date (E.G YEAR-MONTH-DAY 2025-01-22)

the folder contains json files (E.G section1.json etc), for each section of the item shop you want to duplicate the json folder but rename it to section2 section3 etc.
Modify the json files to make the changes to the item shop

Please do not add skins that got released later then 19.10 (chapter 3 season 1)
You can get cosmetics from https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics, Please make sure you copy the CORRECT cosmetic ID and that you put the same V-Bucks price as fortnite.
if you do not know how to get the cosmetic ID or the V-Bucks price, please do not add the skin to the item shop.

#### How to submit
1. make sure the json files are valid
2. zip the folder
3. send the zip folder (ONLY SEND THE DATE, NOT THE ENTIRE PROJECT) to @privateuserttv on discord.

#### Cosmetic ID Fortmat
